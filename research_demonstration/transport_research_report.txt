RESEARCH DEMONSTRATION: AUTOMATED GAMS GENERATION
Problem Type: TRANSPORT
System: Chain-of-Thought GAMS Generator
Generated: 2025-10-01 00:40:23
Status: SUCCESS

RESEARCH CONTEXT:
This demonstration showcases automated generation of optimization problem
formulations using Large Language Models with structured reasoning traces.
The system generates both mathematical reasoning (Chain-of-Thought) and
executable GAMS code for verification and analysis.

============================================================
CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT REASONING TRACE
============================================================
REASONING:
1. Identify sets: plants (seattle, san-diego) and markets (new-york, chicago, topeka)
2. Define parameters: supply capacity at plants, demand at markets, transportation costs
3. Declare decision variables: shipment quantities from each plant to each market
4. Formulate supply constraints: total shipments from each plant must not exceed supply capacity
5. Formulate demand constraints: total shipments to each market must meet or exceed demand
6. Define objective function: minimize total transportation cost = sum of (cost * shipment) for all routes
7. Set variable bounds: all shipment quantities must be non-negative
8. Specify model type: linear programming (LP) since shipments are continuous
