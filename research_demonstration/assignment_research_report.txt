Status: SUCCESS

RESEARCH CONTEXT:
This demonstration showcases automated generation of optimization problem
formulations using Large Language Models with structured reasoning traces.
The system generates both mathematical reasoning (Chain-of-Thought) and
executable GAMS code for verification and analysis.

============================================================
CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT REASONING TRACE
============================================================
REASONING:
1. Identify sets: workers (alice, bob, charlie) and tasks (task1, task2, task3)
2. Define cost parameter: assignment cost matrix showing cost of assigning each worker to each task
3. Declare binary variables: assignment decisions (1 if worker assigned to task, 0 otherwise)
4. Formulate assignment constraints: each worker must be assigned to exactly one task
5. Formulate coverage constraints: each task must be assigned to exactly one worker
6. Define objective: minimize total assignment cost
7. Specify model type: mixed integer programming (MIP) with binary variables
