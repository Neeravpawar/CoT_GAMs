REASONING:
1. Identify sets: products and resources for production planning
2. Define parameters: profit per product, resource usage rates, resource availability
3. Declare continuous variables: production quantities for each product
4. Formulate resource constraints: total resource usage cannot exceed availability
5. Define objective: maximize total profit
6. Specify model type: linear programming (LP)
